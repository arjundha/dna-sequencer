# DNA Sequencer Frontend

This directory holds all the code for the frontend of the project. It calls endpoints from the `dna-backend` directory in the repo. In order to fully use the project, ensure you are running both the backend and frontend on separate hosts and that they are speaking to each other! I hope you have fun!

## Set-Up

1. Navigate to this directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to run the frontend.
4. Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser.
5. Bonus step: Run the server for full functionality!
