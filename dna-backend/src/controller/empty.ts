// TODO: Use strategy pattern to handle different types of sequencing requests
// So we will need an interface for the strategy and a class for each strategy
// Strategies are: DNA --> RNA
//                 RNA --> Protein
//                 DNA --> Protein
//                 Protein --> DNA
//                 Protein --> RNA
//                 RNA --> DNA

// TODO: Decide what pattern to use (strategy might not make as much sense here, might make more sense for file types?)
