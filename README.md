# DNA Sequencer

This application is one that combines my previous Biology degree with my Computer Science degree. Users are able to enter DNA or RNA strands in text-boxes, which will then send the data to the server, which will in turn output the polypeptide chains which the strands coded for.

Users are also able to upload `.txt` files for the same purpose.

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- `Node.js` and `Express`
- `TypeScript`
- `multer` for handling file uploads.
- `Jest`
- `eslint` and `prettier`

### Frontend

- `React` with `TypeScript`
- `Material UI`

## Set-Up

1. In separate terminals, navigate to `dna-backend` and `frontend`.
2. Run `npm install` in both terminals.
3. To run the backend, enter `npm start` to start the server at http://localhost:8000.
4. You can also run `npm test` to run all 226 tests.
5. To run the frontend, enter `npm run dev` and navigate to http://localhost:5173/ in your favourite browser.
6. Play around!
